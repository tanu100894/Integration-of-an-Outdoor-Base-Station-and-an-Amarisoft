# Integration of Outdoor Base Station and Amarisoft 5G Core
The primary objective of this project work is to integrate an outdoor base station and the Amarisoft-5G Core to build a fully working 5G standalone (SA) network. For this project, the completion of the deployment of the emulated 5G Standalone environment involves four primary stages. These stages are outlined as follows:
- Thoroughly examining the PCI Express Board through both general and in-built Built-In-Self-Test (BIST) application testing.
- Configuring and deploying all the software components of Amarisoft for the 5G Core Network ("5GC") and 5G Base Station ("gNB") in standalone mode within the AW2S PC. Additionally, configuring Radio Management Unit (RMU) settings and Swallow driver files in the AW2S PC is part of this stage.
- Configuring and testing the test User Equipment (UEs) along with the provided test USIM cards from Amarisoft.
- Furthermore, conducting call testing on Voice over New Radio (VoNR) and also measuring RF signal strength is integral to this stage.
